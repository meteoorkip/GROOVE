\chapter*{Preface}

We are happy to present to you a document describing the fundamentals of the GROOVE Tool Set. In the coming pages we will provide the reader from a (hopefully) clear overview of the architecture of the tools within the GROOVE Tool Set.

Next to providing an overview of the structure of the tool, it is also meant as a starting point for those people just joining the GROOVE development team. We describe some basic principles that form the ground floor when writing new code for the tool, including some conventions which each developer should apply strictly.

For more information and downloads, we refer to the \GROOVE website: \url{http://groove.sourceforge.net/}
