In this chapter we will discuss the internal structure of the \GROOVE Tool. We will explain the different Java packages all classes and interfaces are spread over.

\section{Packages}

\tblref{packages} enumerates the different packages (in alphabetical order) and gives a short description for each of them.

\section{Class Hierarchies}

\subsection{Graphs}

The notion of graphs can be used at different levels. Especially in \GROOVE, we distinghuis between ordinary graphs just consisting of nodes and labeled and directed edges. On the other hand, we also use graphs to model {\em transition systems} in which the nodes are graphs themselves and edges represent rule applications. In order to make this possible, the \Graph-interface has different sub-interfaces as shown in \fref{graph-hierarchy}.

\end{figure}

Within the GROOVE Tool Set different implementations of graph structures are available. They mainly differ in the way they access their components. \fref{graph-hierarchy} gives an overview of the most frequently used graph implementations. For each of these we will explain the idea behind those specific implementations.
