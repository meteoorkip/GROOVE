\chlabel{Building and Releasing}

Whenever a release is to be build, a fixed set of tasks are to be performed. Firstly, you have to make sure that the latests sources still compile correctly. Thereafter, the JUnit tests must be run succesfully.

In order to automate this process, a ant build script is composed. In this script file, different targets make sure that everything will be done in the correct order and whenever a target fails, the entire process fails, resulting in a notification mail message reporting on what happened exactly.

\section{Build.xml}

The {\tt build.xml} file is included in the {\tt release}-package. The dependencies between the different targets can be visualized in a so called dependency graph. \fref{target-dependencies} shows the dependency graph of the targets in the Ant build script of GROOVE.
