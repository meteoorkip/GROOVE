[... SUMMARY ...]

Minor remarks and comments:

1) page 5: the terminology "embargo condition", "embargo node" should be better explained.
=> [OK] Added a foot note to explain.

2) page 6: As far as I have understood, final states can be quotiented after they are made symmetric by the rename rules, but intermediate states are kept distinct. Is it obvious that this is convenient with respect to starting directly from the renamed start graph and making the transformation rules rules more complicated? In general a good trade off between simplicity of the graph and simplicity of the rules seems to be difficult to find. This could be further discussed also at page 10 (Paragraph: Minimalism is beautiful).
=> [WON'T CHANGE] We already explained this point in detail on the 2nd paragraph of page 6.

3) page 8:
item grammar correctness: I understand what this means, but I would call this point "grammar testing" (correctness is the aim, not what is obtained)
=> [OK] Changed bullet point to "grammar testing".

[... SUMMARY ...]

[... DISCUSSION ...]

Some points in the paper should be improved:

4) - Generality:  Concerning the best practices, the authors state In the introduction that "Some of these guidelines are valid for any graph transformation modelling tool or even for any modelling attempt at all; some are dedicated to GROOVE..". Later, after the best practices have been defined and elaborated in Section 4, I miss a distinction which guidelines are more general and which of them are GROOVE-specific. This would help tool users of other tools to transfer the guidelines to their own tool.
=> [OK] Added a new paragraph on the Guidelines section.

5) - Related Tools: In addition to defining best practice guidelines that are suitable also for other tools than GROOVE, it would be nice to mention just a few of the widest-spread graph transformation tools and name their most distinct features (such as VIATRA2, AGG, DiaGen, Henshin,..), maybe with a reference to http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/rh122/gratra/applications.html. What is the strength of GROOVE compared to other GT tools?
=> [OK] Didn't added this explicitly but pointed the reader to the STTT paper. The URL indicated is very outdated.

6) - To gain space for the above mentioned extensions, Table 3 might be omitted. It is sufficient to state in the text that the state space and running time for the exploration are doubling in size when isomorphism checks are not used. No precise figures are needed.
=> [WON'T CHANGE] The paper is short on "scientific content" as it is; I don't want to remove the table.

7) - Is there any empirical evaluation about tool usage by novice GROOVE users? If not, do you plan to investigate strengths/weaknesses of the tool by a usability study?
=> [OK] Added list as future work. (Which won't be done, of course...)


Details and Typos:
==================
8) page 6, 3rd paragraph:
"The regular expression in Figure 2(b).." -> in Figure 3(a)
=> [OK] Fixed.

9) p.6, 4th par.
"lifts the count to a rule parameter": The meaning of rule parameters is not clear to me. Does it mean that the black integer-number is incremented for each found Q-labelled node? Or does it mean that for each Q, a new int-node is generated and added to the graph, the number of which is the number of the previously generated int-node plus one? Why do you need rule parameters to model this? Please explain in more detail. This is quite important to understand the Prolog code.
=> [WON'T CHANGE] This is properly explained in the last paragraph of page 6.

10) p.8, 3rd par.
"Predicate report selects N elements" -> selects the N first elements
=> [OK] Changed.

11) p.9, last par.
"It is interesting to point that" -> to point out that
=> [OK] Changed.

12) p.11, 3rd par.
"a NP-complete problem" -> an NP-complete problem (Pronunciation counts, not spelling)
=> [OK] Fixed.

13) p.12, 1st par.
"For every rule there is an exception": While this is a nice and true proverb, it should better be omitted in a paper about rule-based modelling to avoid ambiguity.
=> [WON'T CHANGE] This is just pedantic: the sentence is not ambiguous in its context.

Comments
14) - On page 3, a variant of the N-queens problem is described. As far as I can see, this variant is not needed in this paper, and the explanation could be omitted.
=> [WON'T CHANGE] Same reasoning as item 6).

15) - The paper implicitly introduces some of the tool’s more advanced features. Here, a short comparison with other tools would be nice. Which of these features are usually available in other tools? And which of these features are only available in GROOVE?
=> [OK] See item 5).

16) - I think that most of the guidelines that are mentioned in Section 4 are not “GROOVE-specific”, but are also useful when using other tools. Could you perhaps shortly discuss this?
=> [OK] See item 4).

17) - The authors mention in the conclusions that “the text contains a high number of imprecise terms”. To overcome this issue, one could discuss (in more detail), when the best-practice guidelines apply, and when they don’t.
=> [WON'T CHANGE] I don't understand this comment. We tried to point out some special cases along the text, what more should we do? I feel this would require a major overhaul in the paper structure, so I'm ignoring it.
